In order to do so, they need some common sense understanding and supervision can’t be taken for granted.</p> <p>Earlier robotics and reinforcement research mainly focused on problems that required learning a task from scratch. This problem is even present in other fields, such as object detection or speech recognition. However, as opposed to these problems, <strong>humans are generalists</strong> that exploit common structures to solve new problems more efficiently.</p> <p>Going beyond the case of generalist agents, deep multi-task and meta learning useful for any problems where a <strong>common structure</strong> can benefit the efficiency or effectiveness of a model. It can be impractical to develop models for each specific task (e.g. each robot, person, or disease), especially if the data that you have access to for these individual tasks is <strong>scarce</strong>.</p> <p>If you need to <strong>quickly learn something new</strong>, you need to utilize prior experiences (e.g. few-shot learning) to make decisions.</p> <p>But why now? Right now, with the speed of research advancements in AI, many researchers are looking into utilizing multi-model information to develop their models. Especially in robotics, foundation models seem <strong>the</strong> topic in 2024, and many advancements have been made in the past year <d-cite key="zhao2023learning"></d-cite>, <d-cite key="open_x_embodiment_rt_x_2023"></d-cite>, <d-cite key="octo_2023"></d-cite>, <d-cite key="brohan2023rt"></d-cite>.</p> <hr> <h2 id="what-are-tasks">What are tasks?</h2> <p>Given a dataset $\mathcal{D}$ and loss function $\mathcal{L}$, we hope to develop a model $f_\theta$. Different tasks can be used to train this model, with some simple examples being objects, people, objectives, lighting conditions, words, languages, etc.</p> <p>The <strong>critical assumption</strong> here is that different tasks must share some common structure. However, in practice, this is very often the case, even for tasks that seem unrelated. For example the laws of physics and the rules of English can be shared among many tasks.</p> <ol> <li>The multi-task problem: Learn <strong>a set of tasks</strong> more quickly or more proficiently than learning them independently.</li> <li>Given data on previous task(s), learn <strong>a new task</strong> more quickly and/or more proficiently.</li> </ol> <blockquote> <p>Doesn’t multi-task learning reduce to single-task learning?</p> </blockquote> <p>This is indeed the case when aggregating data across multiple tasks, which is actually one approach to multi-task learning. However, what if you want to learn new tasks? And how do you tell the model which task to do? And what if aggregating doesn’t work?</p> <hr> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/blog/cs330/2024-03-01-introduction.bib"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Lars C.P.M.
