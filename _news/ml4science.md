For the [ML4Science](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mlo/ml4science/) project at EPFL, we are hosted by 
[Volvo Group Trucks Technology](https://www.volvogroup.com/en/) and 
[Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/Pages/default.aspx) to work on 
[a project](/projects/ml4science/) about traffic flow prediction for autonomous driving.
