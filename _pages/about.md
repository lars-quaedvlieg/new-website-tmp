I am currently a **Research Scientist intern** in the <i>Core Learning & Reasoning</i> team at [Meta](https://ai.meta.com/research/). I recently finished my MSc in Data Science at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/data-science/), where I worked as a [Research Assistant](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/education/master/research-scholars/) in the 
[Caglar Gulcehre Lab for AI Research](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/claire/). I am also a recipient of the 
[EPFL Excellence Fellowship](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/master-excellence-fellowships/). My research is focused on foundation models and reinforcement learning, specifically, **evolutionary search with LLMs** and **AI4Math**.

Below, I have created an interactive timeline to share my experiences. Feel free to navigate through 
it and click on any activity that captures your interest for more information. For further details, please feel free to 
explore the [publications](/publications/) and [projects](/projects/) pages!

When I'm not doing research or working on my side projects, you can find me in the calisthenics parks ðŸ¤¸ or playing [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/) ðŸŒŽ.
